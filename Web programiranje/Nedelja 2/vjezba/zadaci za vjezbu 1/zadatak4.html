    <p>You get a shiver in the dark<br>
        It's raining in the park but meantime<br>
        South of the river you stop and you hold everything<br>
        A band is blowing Dixie double four time<br>
        You feel alright when you hear that music ring<br>
        You step inside but you don't see too many faces<br>
        Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down<br>
        Too much competition too many other places<br>
        But not too many horns can make that sound<br>
        Way on downsouth way on downsouth London town<br>
        You check out Guitar George he knows all the chords<br>
        Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing<br>
        And an old guitar is all he can afford<br>
        When he gets up under the lights to play his thing<br>
        And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene<br>
        He's got a daytime job he's doing alright<br>
        He can play honky tonk just like anything<br>
        Saving it up for Friday night<br>
        With the Sultans<br>
        With the Sultans of Swing<br>
        And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner<br>
        Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles<br>
        The don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band<br>
        It ain't what they call rock and roll<br>
        And the Sultans played Creole<br>
        And then the man he steps right up to the microphone<br>
        And says at last just as the time bell rings<br>
        'Thank you goodnight now it's time to go home'<br>
        And he makes it fast whith one more thing<br>
        'We are the Sultans of Swing'<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            People are strange when you're a stranger<br>
Faces look ugly when you're alone<br>
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted<br>
Streets are uneven when you're down<br>
When you're strange<br>
Faces come out of the rain<br>
When you're strange<br>
No one remembers your name<br>
When you're strange<br>
When you're strange<br>
When you're strange<br>
People are strange when you're a stranger<br>
Faces look ugly when you're alone<br>
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted<br>
Streets are uneven when you're down<br>
When you're strange<br>
Faces come out of the rain<br>
When you're strange<br>
No one remembers your name<br>
When you're strange<br>
When you're strange<br>
When you're strange<br>
When you're strange<br>
Faces come out of the rain<br>
When you're strange<br>
No one remembers your name<br>
When you're strange<br>
When you're strange<br>
When you're strange<br>

        <h1 id="C3">RHCP-Californication</h1>
        <p>Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation<br>
            And little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation<br>
            And if you want these kind of dreams it's Californication<br>
            It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization<br>
            The sun may rise in the East at least it's settled in a final location<br>
            It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication<br>
            Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging<br>
            Celebrity skin, is this your chin, or is that war you're waging?<br>
            First born unicorn<br>
            Hardcore soft porn<br>
            Dream of Californication<br>
            Dream of Californication<br>
            Dream of Californication<br>
            Dream of Californication<br>
            Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation<br>
            A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information<br>
            And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication<br>
            Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement<br>
            And Cobain can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station To Station?<br>
            And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication<br>
            Born and raised by those who praise control of population<br>
            Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean on vacation<br>
            First born unicorn<br>
            Hardcore soft porn<br>
            Dream of Californication<br>
            Dream of Californication<br>
            Dream of Californication<br>
            Dream of Californication<br>
            Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation<br>
            And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration<br>
            And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication<br>
            Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging<br>
            Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving?<br>

            <p>I'm a puppet on a string<br>
                Tracy Island, time-travelin' diamond cutter-shaped heartaches<br>
                Come to find you four in some velvet mornin' years too late<br>
                She's a silver linin', lone ranger ridin' through an open space<br>
                In my mind, when she's not right there beside me<br>
                I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be<br>
                And satisfaction feels like a distant memory<br>
                And I can't help myself<br>
                All I wanna ever say is, "Are you mine?"<br>
                Well, are you mine?<br>
                Are you mine?<br>
                Are you mine? Oh, ah<br>
                I guess what I'm tryin' to say is I need the deep end<br>
                Keep imaginin' meetin', wished away entire lifetimes<br>
                Unfair we're not somewhere misbehavin' for days<br>
                Great escape, lost track of time and space<br>
                She's a silver linin', climbin' on my desire<br>
                And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be<br>
                And satisfaction feels like a distant memory<br>
                And I can't help myself<br>
                All I wanna ever say is, "Are you mine?"<br>
                Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)<br>
                Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)<br>
                Are you mine? (Are you mine? Mine?)<br>
                And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways<br>
                So in case I'm mistaken, I<br>
                Just wanna hear you say, "You got me baby"<br>
                "Are you mine?"<br>
                She's a silver linin', lone ranger ridin' through an open space<br>
                In my mind, when she's not right there beside me<br>
                I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be<br>
                And satisfaction feels like a distant memory<br>
                And I can't help myself<br>
                All I wanna ever say is, "Are you mine?"<br>
                Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)<br>
                Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)<br>
                Are you mine? (Are you mine? Mine?)</p><br><br>
